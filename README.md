# Predicting Traffic Severity 

### Business Problem

The governor of New York, Andrew Cuomo, wants to use the highway and local road teleprompters to help drivers be more cautious while driving in high risk weather conditions. He doesn't want to leave the signage up all the time because he fears that will make the message less impactful. Instead, Cuomo wants to know the daily traffic forcasts from weather-induced accidents. He believes that this information will lead to saved lives, fewer accidents, and less overall traffic.
